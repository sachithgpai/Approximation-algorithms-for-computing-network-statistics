The objective of the project is to obtain an in-depth understanding of graph-mining algorithms. We got the chance to experiment with algorithms that compute distances on large graphs using randomized algorithms.
Implementation of a Flajolet-Martin based approximation algorithm for computing the distance distribution of large graphs.
